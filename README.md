# AB Test for Marketing Campaign Ads

This repository contains a Python script that can be used to conduct A/B testing for marketing campaign ads. A/B testing is a powerful technique used by marketers to compare two versions of an ad and determine which version is more effective. The script takes in two sets of data, one for each version of the ad, and calculates statistical metrics such as p-values and confidence intervals to determine which version is better. The script also generates visualizations such as histograms and box plots to help you better understand the data. This tool can be especially useful for marketers who want to optimize their ad campaigns and increase their conversion rates.
